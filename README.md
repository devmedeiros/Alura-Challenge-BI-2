# Alura Challenge BI 2

> Este README também está disponível em [Português](https://github.com/devmedeiros/Alura-Challenge-BI-2/blob/main/README.md)!

The Alura Challenge BI is a four-week event where we're challenged to make BI dashboards according to the request of three made-up companies. In this repository, you can find individual folders for each dashboard where you can find the datasets used, example images, and the `pbix` file. If you want to see the dashboard live please go to [this blog post](https://devmedeiros.com/post/alura-challenge-bi-2/) where I embed the three dashboards and gave a small explanation on each of them.

To learn more about the challenge please visit the official [page](https://www.alura.com.br/challenges/bi-2?host=https://cursos.alura.com.br).

# Alura Films Dashboard 🎞️

Alura Films asked us to calculate the following measures:

- The gross revenue of a movie by actors
- Most voted movies
- Most profitable movie genres
- Actors with more movies
- Explore meta score, IMDB, and vote count
- The most explored movie genres
- Parental rating
- Translate columns (the data arrived in English and the project was proposed in Portuguese)

Most of the data cleaning was done using Power BI. For the exception of parental rating, as I classified it myself, given that most of it needed to be searched and I wanted to try to fit all of them in the Brazilian Parental Rating. The columns were translated using Google Sheets, I had to correct a few translations myself, like `Western -> Faroeste`.

# Dashboard Alura Food 🍝

**Alura Food** asked the participants to calculate the following measures:

- Filter by city, restaurant and if it has a reservation
- Total restaurants in India
- Average price
- Average rating
- Percentage of restaurants that does and doesn't has online delivery
- Cities that have more restaurants
- Most explored cuisines in India
- Restaurants by city and its classifications

I cleaned the data through Power BI, translated a few texts from English to Portuguese through Google Sheets, and converted the meals price from their respective currency value to BRL (Brazillian Currency).
