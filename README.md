# Alura Challenge BI

The Alura Challenge BI is a four-week event where we're challenged to make BI dashboards according to the request of three made-up companies.

- [x] The first company, **Alura Films**, needs to analyze IMDB data about movies and their information. See the dashboard [here](https://bit.ly/3uZP9MD).
- [ ] The second company, **Alura Food**, needs a dashboard to analyze the restaurant market in India.
- [ ] The third company, **Alura Skimo**, needs to analyze measures about their sales.

In this repository, you can find individual folders for each dashboard. Inside the folders, there will be a small markdown document explaining the task and dashboard.

At the end of the challenge, I'll be uploading a blog post about the experience and I'll showcase all the dashboards at the same place.
