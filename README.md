# Alura Challenge BI

The Alura Challenge BI is a four-week event where we're challenged to make BI dashboards according to the request of three made-up companies.

- [x] The first company, **Alura Films**, needs to analyze IMDB data about movies and their information. See the dashboard [here](https://bit.ly/3HnLPxt).
- [x] The second company, **Alura Food**, needs a dashboard to analyze the restaurant market in India. See the dashboard [here](https://bit.ly/3tawI5h).
- [x] The third company, **Alura Skimo**, needs to analyze measures about their sales. See the dashboard [here](https://bit.ly/3pNOxq4).

In this repository, you can find individual folders for each dashboard. Inside the folders, there will be a small markdown document explaining the task and dashboard.
