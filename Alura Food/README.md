# Dashboard Alura Food

**Alura Food** asked the participants to calculate the following measures:

 - Filter by city, restaurant and if it has a reservation
 - Total restaurants in India
 - Average price
 - Average rating
 - Percentage of restaurants that does and doesn't has online delivery
 - Cities that have more restaurants
 - Most explored cuisines in India
 - Restaurants by city and its classifications

I cleaned the data through Power BI, translated a few texts from English to Portuguese through Google Sheets, and converted the meals price from their respective currency value to BRL (Brazillian Currency). You can see the live dashboard [here](https://bit.ly/3tawI5h).
